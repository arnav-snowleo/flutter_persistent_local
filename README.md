# flutter_persistent_local

The original "flutter create" app re-written entirely with Stateless Widgets, using Provider to hold the app data-state. And now including:
- persistent storage for the app state, via SharedPreferences

## Getting Started

This project is a follow-on from my previous project located at https://github.com/eggzotic/flutter_create_stateless, which demonstrates how the original "flutter create ..." app can be written with Stateless Widgets only. Now we add persistent state via local (on-device) storage using Shared Preferences

Using the Provider and SharedPreferences packages, we manage persistent state.
