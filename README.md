# stateless_demo

The original "flutter create" app re-written entirely with Stateless Widgets, using Provider to hold the app data-state. Could be useful as a reference for anyone, like me(!), who prefers Stateless Widgets ;-)

## Getting Started

This project is an alternate starting point for a Flutter application.

An intro to the capabilities of the Provider Plugin, by showing how it can replace the state of a Stateful Widget, using the default "flutter create" app. The original (Stateful Widget based) code is also here in the main.dart.orig file, for side-by-side comparison.

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
